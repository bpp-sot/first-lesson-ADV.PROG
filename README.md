# Flask Learning Project

## Overview
This repository contains Flask applications and backend development exercises for the **Advanced Programming** module in our third year at university.

## Purpose
We are learning Flask framework and backend development fundamentals, including:
- Creating REST APIs
- Building web applications
- Error handling and logging
- HTTP request/response cycles
- JSON data processing

## Files in this Project

- **`health_check.py`** - Health monitoring API with multiple endpoints
- **`jsonify.py`** - Division API demonstrating JSON responses and error handling
- **`hello.py`** - Basic Flask application introduction
- **`interaction.py`** - Interactive Flask application examples
- **`greeting.txt`** - Simple text file for application data

## Running the Applications

To run any Flask application:

```bash
python3 <filename>.py
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5000` in your browser or use curl to test endpoints.

## Learning Goals

- Understanding Flask framework architecture
- Implementing RESTful API design patterns
- Managing application errors and exceptions
- Working with HTTP methods and status codes
- Building maintainable backend code structure
